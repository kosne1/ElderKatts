            From the <b>airdrop</b> you can take one of nine cards. So each card can improve a warlordâ€™s <b>attack</b>, <b>defense</b> or <b>intelligence</b> and can be <b>common</b>, <b>rare</b>, or <b>epic</b>.
            From every attempt you have a 10% chance to have an epic card, a 30% chance to take a rare one, and a 60% chance to take a common.
            We have a good tokenomic so, epic cards will increase warlord on <b>6 points</b>, rare on <b>3 points</b> and common on <b>1 point</b>.
